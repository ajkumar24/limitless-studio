# Limitless Studio System - Requirements & Implementation Plan

## üìã Executive Summary

**Project**: Limitless Studio System for The Limitless Company
**Purpose**: Internal video content production workflow management
**Approach**: Simple, practical implementation focused on core workflow that can scale
**Timeline**: 7 phases, ~3-4 weeks total development

### Key Principles
- **Core workflow first** - Focus on making the REACH process work perfectly for internal team
- **Simple solutions** - Avoid over-engineering, choose proven approaches
- **Growth ready** - Build foundation that can expand to full client requirements later
- **Team focused** - Optimize for 20-person internal team initially, scale to clients afterward

---

## üéØ Project Context & Vision

### Current Situation
The Limitless Company currently uses ClickUp for managing video content production across multiple clients. Due to nested subtasks, fragmented checklists, and overwhelming dashboards, critical steps are often forgotten or delayed. Videos stall between handoffs, feedback loops lag, and project managers spend time manually following up.

### Target Vision
A **self-managing production brain** - an internal operating system that automatically coordinates Limitless's video pipeline, ensures approvals happen on time, and alerts staff before bottlenecks occur.

### Success Definition
- **Eliminate time gaps** between REACH stages
- **Clear role-based dashboards** for each contributor
- **Automated tracking and alerts** for overdue items
- **Streamlined approvals** and progressions
- **Real-time visibility** into pipeline health

---

## üèóÔ∏è Core Requirements (Simplified for MVP)

### 1. REACH Workflow Management
**Priority**: Critical - Core system purpose

- **Five visual columns**: Research ‚Üí Envision ‚Üí Assemble ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Hone
- **Content Cards**: Each card = one video project
- **Drag-and-drop**: Move cards between stages with automatic notifications
- **Stage-specific checklists**: Each stage has deliverable requirements
- **Time tracking**: Monitor how long cards spend in each stage

### 2. User Role Management (7 Roles)
**Priority**: High - Essential for workflow

| Role | Primary Access | Key Responsibilities |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Admin/Manager** | All stages + team management | Oversee operations, review performance |
| **Strategist** | Research + Envision + approvals | Approve scripts, edits, final videos |
| **Scriptwriter** | Research + Envision | Write and revise scripts |
| **Editor/Designer** | Assemble + Connect | Edit videos, design thumbnails |
| **Coordinator** | Connect + Hone + orchestration | Manage publishing, track analytics |
| **Client** | Connect stage + limited view | Approve ideas/scripts, provide feedback |
| **AI System** | Monitoring + alerts | *Future: automated tracking and escalation* |

### 3. Basic Client Management
**Priority**: Medium - Simplified for MVP

- **Client profiles**: Basic company info and contact details
- **Content association**: Link cards to specific clients
- **Approval workflow**: Client can approve/reject in Connect stage

### 4. Team Collaboration
**Priority**: High - Core workflow dependency

- **Comments system**: Already implemented with @mentions
- **File attachments**: PDF, images, documents (local storage initially)
- **Task assignments**: Assign team members to cards
- **Status updates**: Real-time notifications when cards move

### 5. Automated Monitoring (Simplified)
**Priority**: Medium - Start simple, evolve to AI

- **Time-based alerts**: If cards stay too long in stages
- **Slack notifications**: Key workflow events
- **Deadline tracking**: Due dates and reminders
- **Escalation logic**: Alert managers when team members don't respond
