   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify database is running
   - Try different user credentials

2. **Permission Errors**:
   - Check user role assignment in database
   - Verify team membership
   - Clear browser cache and re-login

3. **Notification Issues**:
   - Refresh page to trigger notification refresh
   - Check if assignment was created successfully
   - Verify notification API endpoints are working

```sql
SELECT ca.id, u.first_name, u.last_name, ca.role, ca.assigned_at, ca.notes
FROM card_assignments ca
JOIN users u ON ca.assigned_to = u.id
ORDER BY ca.assigned_at DESC;
```

### **Check Notifications**
