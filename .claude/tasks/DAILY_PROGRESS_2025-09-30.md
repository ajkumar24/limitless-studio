## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Test User Passwords
**Problem**: Tried to login with `password123` but actual password is role-specific
**Solution**: Read seed file, found correct passwords (e.g., `editor123`, `scriptwriter123`)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Multiple Dev Servers Running
**Problem**: Background bash processes showing EADDRINUSE errors
**Solution**: Not critical, multiple dev servers attempting to run on port 3000
**Status**: ⚠️ Not fixed (not blocking development)

## 📝 Key Learnings

1. **Playwright Testing** is highly effective for UI testing:
   - Can verify navigation flows
   - Can test role-based access control
   - Can capture visual evidence with screenshots
   - Can fill forms and submit data

2. **Role-Based Filtering** in sidebar works perfectly:
   - Admin sees all navigation items
   - Non-admin users see filtered menu
   - Access control enforced at page level (redirects work)

3. **Client Onboarding Wizard** is user-friendly:
   - 4-step process is clear and intuitive
   - Progress indicator helps users track completion
   - Form validation prevents errors

## 🎯 Next Steps (Recommendation)

### Option A: Complete Phase 6 (Recommended)
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: HIGH

Remaining tasks:
1. Build client detail/edit page
2. Integrate ClientProfileSidebar with Kanban board
3. Test and polish

**Rationale**: We're 85% done with Phase 6. Finishing it provides complete client management functionality for admins and brand guidelines access for team members.

### Option B: Move to Phase 7 - AI Orchestration
**Time**: 2 days
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Rationale**: Phase 7 database schema is already done, but we'd be leaving Phase 6 incomplete.
