# Content OS MVP - Overall Implementation Plan

## Project Vision
Build an internal Content Operating System for content creation agencies - "Trello for content creators" with REACH workflow (Research → Envision → Assemble → Connect → Hone).

## MVP Requirements Summary
- **Internal app**: 20 users max, invite-only access
- **Multi-team**: Simple team structure
- **Auth**: Email/password with role-based access (admin/member/client)
- **File storage**: Local uploads initially
- **Deployment**: Contabo VPS with Docker
- **Keep it simple**: No over-engineering

## 6-Phase Implementation Plan

- [ ] Docker Compose v2 (web, db, pgadmin)
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Development workflow scripts

**Deliverables:**
- Working local development environment
- Production-ready Docker configuration
- Database connection established

---

### Phase 2: Database Foundation
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Solid data layer with user management

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Protected API routes
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Admin user management (create users)

**Deliverables:**
- Login/logout functionality
- Role-based permissions working
- Admin can create users

---

### Phase 4: Core Kanban Structure
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Goal**: Basic REACH workflow

**Tasks:**
- [ ] REACH stages setup (Research → Envision → Assemble → Connect → Hone)
- [ ] Content Cards CRUD operations
- [ ] Basic team management
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality (dnd-kit)
- [ ] Card details modal

**Deliverables:**
- Working Kanban board
- Cards can move between stages
- Basic card creation/editing

---

### Phase 5: Collaboration Features
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Goal**: Team collaboration tools

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Comments system with mentions
- [ ] Subtask management with assignments
- [ ] File upload system (local storage)
- [ ] User notifications (basic)
- [ ] Team member assignments

**Deliverables:**
- Full collaboration features
- File attachments working
- Comments and mentions functional

---

### Phase 6: UI/UX Polish
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Goal**: Production-ready interface

**Tasks:**
- [ ] shadcn/ui component integration
- [ ] Responsive design implementation
- [ ] Error handling and validation
- [ ] Loading states and feedback
- [ ] Final UX refinements

**Deliverables:**
- Polished, responsive interface
- Proper error handling
- Production-ready MVP

## Success Criteria for MVP

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Teams can create and manage content cards
- ✅ Cards move through REACH workflow stages
- ✅ Comments, mentions, and file attachments work
- ✅ Role-based permissions enforced
- ✅ Admin can manage users and teams

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Docker environment runs reliably
- ✅ Database migrations work properly
- ✅ Authentication is secure
- ✅ File uploads handle common formats
- ✅ Ready for Contabo VPS deployment

### User Experience
- ✅ Interface is intuitive for content teams
- ✅ Collaboration feels natural
- ✅ Performance is acceptable for 20 users
- ✅ Works on desktop and mobile

## Technology Decisions Rationale

### Stack Choices
- **Next.js + TypeScript**: Full-stack, type-safe, production-ready
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle**: Relational data with type-safe ORM
- **NextAuth.js**: Battle-tested authentication
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind**: Modern, accessible UI components
- **dnd-kit**: Reliable drag-and-drop for Kanban

### Architecture Principles
- **Simple over complex**: Choose proven, straightforward solutions
- **Production-ready**: Every choice considers deployment requirements
- **Team-focused**: Optimize for collaboration and multi-user workflows
- **Extensible**: Build foundation that can grow into SaaS later

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Docker complexity**: Use proven patterns, test early
- **Database design**: Keep schema simple, plan for changes
- **Authentication security**: Follow NextAuth.js best practices
- **File storage**: Start local, design for cloud migration

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP requirements, document future features
- **Performance**: Test with realistic data early
- **Deployment**: Prepare for Contabo VPS from day 1
