# Content OS MVP - Overall Implementation Plan

## Project Vision
Build an internal Content Operating System for content creation agencies - "Trello for content creators" with REACH workflow (Research ‚Üí Envision ‚Üí Assemble ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Hone).

## MVP Requirements Summary
- **Internal app**: 20 users max, invite-only access
- **Multi-team**: Simple team structure
- **Auth**: Email/password with role-based access (admin/member/client)
- **File storage**: Local uploads initially
- **Deployment**: Contabo VPS with Docker
- **Keep it simple**: No over-engineering

## üìù Key Decisions & Requirements (From Initial Discussions)

### **Authentication Strategy**
- **NO OAuth Google** (initially considered but rejected)
  - Reason: Would allow anyone with Google account to attempt login
  - Not suitable for internal 20-person team
- **Email/Password Only** with invite-only system
- **Admin creates user accounts** ‚Üí **Slack notifications** when accounts are created
- **Forced password change** on first login
- **Seeded admin user** with random 8-character password

### **Slack Integration Points**
- **User account creation notifications** - When admin creates new user accounts
- **Future Phase**: General notifications for deadlines and approvals (mentioned in original requirements)
- **Not for authentication** - Only for notifications

### **Team Structure (Simple)**
- Users belong to **one primary team**
- Teams can **share certain cards if needed** (keep minimal)
- **Multi-team support** but simple implementation
- **Max 20 users total** across all teams initially

### **File Upload Strategy**
- **Start with local file storage** in `/uploads` folder
- **Common file types**: PDF, images (PNG/JPG), docs (DOC/DOCX)
- **10MB file size limit** initially
- **Ready for cloud migration** (S3) in future phases
- **Interface designed** to switch storage backends easily

### **User Roles & Permissions**
- **Admin**:
  - Manage team and users
  - All content access
  - Can create/delete user accounts
  - First user becomes admin automatically (via seeder)
- **Member**:
  - Create/edit cards, tasks, comments
  - Full collaboration features
- **Client/Approver**:
  - View and comment on content
  - Approve content in Connect stage
  - Limited access scope

### **AI Integration (Future Phases)**
- **Phase 5+**: Optional AI features
- **Content cards**: "Suggest Ideas/Hooks" button
- **Hone stage**: "Summarize Analytics" insights
- **Switchable provider architecture** (OpenAI, etc.)
- **Keep lightweight and contextual**

### **Original Business Context**
From job posting requirements:
- **Content creation workflow**: Video ideation ‚Üí scripting ‚Üí editing ‚Üí publishing ‚Üí A/B testing
- **Multi-role collaboration**: Video editors, scriptwriters, producers, stakeholders
- **Clear tracking**: Projects, timelines, deliverables
- **User alerts**: Deadlines and approvals
- **Proprietary methodology**: Embed content creation process into workflow
- **Future SaaS potential**: Scale to external agencies later

## Success Criteria for MVP

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ Teams can create and manage content cards
- ‚úÖ Cards move through REACH workflow stages
- ‚úÖ Comments, mentions, and file attachments work
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions enforced
- ‚úÖ Admin can manage users and teams

### Technical Requirements
- ‚úÖ Docker environment runs reliably
- ‚úÖ Database migrations work properly
- ‚úÖ Authentication is secure
- ‚úÖ File uploads handle common formats
- ‚úÖ Ready for Contabo VPS deployment

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ Interface is intuitive for content teams
- ‚úÖ Collaboration feels natural
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable for 20 users
- ‚úÖ Works on desktop and mobile

## Technology Decisions Rationale

### Stack Choices
- **Next.js + TypeScript**: Full-stack, type-safe, production-ready
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle**: Relational data with type-safe ORM
- **NextAuth.js**: Battle-tested authentication
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind**: Modern, accessible UI components
- **dnd-kit**: Reliable drag-and-drop for Kanban

### Architecture Principles
- **Simple over complex**: Choose proven, straightforward solutions
- **Production-ready**: Every choice considers deployment requirements
- **Team-focused**: Optimize for collaboration and multi-user workflows
- **Extensible**: Build foundation that can grow into SaaS later

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### **Slack Integration Architecture**
- **Webhook-based notifications** (not OAuth)
- **Environment variable**: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for team notifications
- **Notification triggers**:
  - User account creation (admin creates new user)
  - Important deadline reminders
  - Approval requests in Connect stage
- **Keep lightweight**: Simple webhook POST requests, no complex Slack app

### **Database Design Considerations**
- **Multi-team structure**: Users belong to primary team, but can collaborate across teams
- **Role inheritance**: Roles are user-level, not team-level (simpler for 20-user internal app)
- **Content sharing**: Simple flag on content cards for cross-team visibility
- **Audit trail**: Track who created/modified content for accountability

### **File Storage Evolution Path**
```
Phase 1-4: Local storage (/uploads)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Simple file handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10MB limit for MVP
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic security checks

Future Phases: Cloud storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S3-compatible interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CDN integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Advanced file management
```

### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. Admin creates user account
2. System generates random 8-char password
3. Slack notification sent to team
4. User logs in with temporary password
5. Forced to change password on first login
6. Session management via NextAuth
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Docker complexity**: Use proven patterns, test early
- **Database design**: Keep schema simple, plan for changes
- **Authentication security**: Follow NextAuth.js best practices
- **File storage**: Start local, design for cloud migration

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP requirements, document future features
- **Performance**: Test with realistic data early
- **Deployment**: Prepare for Contabo VPS from day 1
