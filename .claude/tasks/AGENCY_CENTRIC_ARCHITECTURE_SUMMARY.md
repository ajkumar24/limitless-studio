# Agency-Centric Architecture - Implementation Summary

## 📋 **Document Overview**

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Resolved fundamental architecture issue

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

### **Original Issue**
When creating a new client "Acme Corp", the assignment dropdown was empty - newly created users couldn't be assigned to cards on client boards.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Fundamental confusion between two concepts:
- **Teams**: Internal agency organizational units
- **Clients**: External companies/customers

The system was treating clients as teams, expecting each client to have its own team members. This created an impossible workflow where:
1. Admin creates client → Creates team for client
2. Admin creates new user → User not added to any team
3. Admin tries to assign user to client's card → User not available (not in client's "team")

### **The Question**
*"Are clients separate from teams, or is each client essentially their own team?"*

---

## 💡 **Architecture Decision: Agency-Centric Model**

### **Selected Approach: Option A - Agency-Centric**

**Core Concept**: One unified "Main Agency Team" containing all internal staff members.

### **Why This Model?**

✅ **Matches Real-World Agency Structure**
- Agencies have one internal team (staff members)
- Staff work across multiple client accounts
- Clients are customers, not team members

✅ **Simplifies Assignment Workflow**
- All agency members available for any client's work
- No need to manually add users to each client
- Flexible resource allocation

✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Main Agency Team**: Internal staff (strategists, scriptwriters, editors, etc.)
- **Clients**: External companies with profile data only

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation Details**

### **1. Main Agency Team Creation**

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Renamed existing team
UPDATE teams
SET name = 'Main Agency Team',
    description = 'Internal agency team - all staff members',
    is_client = false
WHERE name = 'Test Agency Team';
```

**Result**: One non-client team serves as the agency roster.

---

### **2. API Endpoint - Agency Members**

**New File**: `frontend/src/app/api/teams/agency/members/route.ts`

```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Get Main Agency Team (first non-client team)
  const mainAgencyTeam = await db
    .select()
    .from(teams)
    .where(eq(teams.isClient, false))
    .limit(1)

  // Get all members of the Main Agency Team
  const members = await db
    .select({
      id: users.id,
      email: users.email,
      firstName: users.firstName,
      lastName: users.lastName,
      role: users.role,
      avatar: users.avatar,
    })
    .from(teamMembers)
    .innerJoin(users, eq(teamMembers.userId, users.id))
    .where(eq(teamMembers.teamId, mainAgencyTeam[0].id))

  return NextResponse.json(members)
}
```

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/teams/agency/members`
**Purpose**: Fetch all internal agency staff members

---

### **3. React Query Hook**

**File**: `frontend/src/lib/hooks/useAssignments.ts`

```typescript
// Get all Main Agency Team members (agency-centric model)
export function useAgencyMembers() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['agency-members'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/teams/agency/members')
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch agency members')
      return response.json()
    },
  })
}
```

**Key**: `['agency-members']` (global, not team-specific)
**Purpose**: Fetch agency members for any client's assignments

---

### **4. Assignment Panel Update**

**File**: `frontend/src/components/assignments/AssignmentPanel.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
const { data: teamMembers = [], isLoading: membersLoading } = useTeamMembers(teamId)
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { useCardAssignments, useAgencyMembers, useAssignUser, useUnassignUser, useUpdateAssignment } from '@/lib/hooks/useAssignments'

// Use agency members instead of team-specific members (agency-centric model)
const { data: teamMembers = [], isLoading: membersLoading } = useAgencyMembers()
```

**Result**: Assignment dropdown now shows all agency members regardless of which client board you're on.

---

### **5. Auto-Add Users to Main Agency Team**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/api/users/route.ts`

```typescript
// Add user to Main Agency Team automatically (non-client users only)
if (validatedData.role !== 'client') {
  const mainAgencyTeam = await db
    .select()
    .from(teams)
    .where(eq(teams.isClient, false))
    .limit(1)

  if (mainAgencyTeam && mainAgencyTeam.length > 0) {
    await db.insert(teamMembers).values({
      teamId: mainAgencyTeam[0].id,
      userId: newUser[0].id,
    })
  }
}
```

**Trigger**: User creation (POST `/api/users`)
**Logic**: Automatically add all non-client users to Main Agency Team
**Result**: New users immediately available for assignments

## 📊 **Data Structure**

### **Main Agency Team**
```
Team ID: aae5fa2d-4684-4127-95e8-47162c667eef
Name: Main Agency Team
Description: Internal agency team - all staff members
Is Client: false
Members: 7 users (Admin, Sarah, Mike, Emma, David, Coordinator, Rodelo)
```

### **Client Teams** (Examples)
```
Client: Acme Corp
Team ID: 0f05cc1c-780e-4b0f-a8ba-c7aa42113147
Is Client: true
Members: 0 (clients don't have team members)
```

---

## 🚀 **Future Considerations**

### **Potential Enhancements**
- [ ] Multi-agency support (for agencies with regional offices)
- [ ] Department sub-teams within Main Agency Team
- [ ] Client access permissions (view-only for client users)
- [ ] Resource capacity planning (assignments per user)

### **Not Needed (Agency-Centric Model)**
- ❌ Client-specific team membership
- ❌ Per-client user onboarding
- ❌ Duplicate user accounts for different clients
- ❌ Complex team switching logic

---

## 📝 **Key Takeaways**

### **Architecture Principle**
> **"One Agency Team, Many Clients"**
>
> All internal staff belong to the Main Agency Team. Clients are external entities with profile data. Assignments pull from the agency roster, enabling flexible resource allocation across all client accounts.

### **Implementation Success**
✅ Assignment dropdown now works correctly across all client boards
✅ New users automatically available for assignments
✅ Clear conceptual separation between teams and clients
✅ Scalable model for growing agency roster and client base
