### **Current State**

‚úÖ Notification queue system operational
‚úÖ Worker service processing jobs successfully
‚úÖ Database notifications working
‚úÖ Queue monitoring dashboard functional
‚è∏Ô∏è Slack integration pending (awaiting webhook URL)

### **Goal**

Enable real-time Slack notifications for:

- User assignments (new card assigned to you)
- @mentions in comments
- Due date reminders (future enhancement)

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Checklist**

### **Task 1: Slack Service Enhancement** üì±

**File**: `worker/src/services/slack.service.ts`
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// Placeholder - webhook URL needed
console.log("üì¢ Slack notification (webhook not configured):", message);
```

**Changes Needed**:

- [ ] Add Slack webhook URL from environment variable
- [ ] Implement Slack Web API client using `@slack/webhook`
- [ ] Create message formatting for different notification types
- [ ] Add error handling for failed Slack API calls
- [ ] Add retry logic (automatic via Bull queue)
- [ ] Support mentions with Slack user IDs

**Environment Variables Required**:

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
# Optional: For richer integrations
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
```

---

### **Task 2: Message Formatting** üí¨

**Notification Types to Support**:

#### **1. Assignment Notification** ‚≠ê PRIORITY

```typescript
{
  type: 'assignment',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  cardId: 'card-uuid',
  assignedBy: 'admin-uuid',
  cardTitle: 'Create landing page design'
}
```

**Slack Message Format**:

```
üéØ *New Assignment*
You've been assigned to: *Create landing page design*
Assigned by: Admin Manager
View card: http://app.example.com/dashboard?card=card-uuid
```

#### **2. @Mention Notification**

```typescript
{
  type: 'mention',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  commentId: 'comment-uuid',
  cardId: 'card-uuid',
  cardTitle: 'Review script outline',
  mentionedBy: 'strategist-uuid',
  commentPreview: '@sarah can you review this?'
}
```

**Slack Message Format**:

```
üí¨ *Mentioned in Comment*
Sarah Strategist mentioned you in: *Review script outline*
"@sarah can you review this?"
View comment: http://app.example.com/dashboard?card=card-uuid#comment-comment-uuid
```

#### **3. New User Welcome Notification** (Optional Enhancement)

```typescript
{
  type: 'user_created',
  userId: 'new-user-uuid',
  userName: 'Sarah Johnson',
  userEmail: 'sarah@example.com',
  userRole: 'scriptwriter',
  createdBy: 'admin-uuid'
}
```

**Slack Message Format**:

```
üëã *New Team Member Added*
Welcome *Sarah Johnson* to the team!
üìß Email: sarah@example.com
üë§ Role: Scriptwriter
Added by: Admin User
```

---

### **Task 3: Slack Webhook Integration** üîå

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Install Slack SDK** (if not already installed)

   ```bash
   cd worker
   npm install @slack/webhook
   ```

2. **Update `slack.service.ts`**:

   ```typescript
   import { IncomingWebhook } from "@slack/webhook";

   export class SlackService {
     private webhook: IncomingWebhook;

     constructor() {
       const webhookUrl = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL;
       if (!webhookUrl) {
         console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL not configured");
         return;
       }
       this.webhook = new IncomingWebhook(webhookUrl);
     }

     async sendNotification(notification: NotificationJob): Promise<void> {
       if (!this.webhook) {
         console.log("üì¢ Slack webhook not configured, skipping...");
         return;
       }

       const message = this.formatMessage(notification);

       try {
         await this.webhook.send(message);
         console.log("‚úÖ Slack notification sent successfully");
       } catch (error) {
         console.error("‚ùå Failed to send Slack notification:", error);
         throw error; // Bull will retry
       }
     }

     private formatMessage(notification: NotificationJob) {
       // Format based on notification type
       // Return Slack Block Kit format
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update Worker Processor**:
   - No changes needed if `slackService.sendNotification()` is already called
   - Verify error handling propagates to Bull for retries

---

### **Task 4: Environment Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

**Files to Update**:

1. **`.env` (local development)**:

   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

2. **`.env.production` (VPS server)**:

   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. **`docker-compose.yml`** (if not using .env):

   ```yaml
   worker:
     environment:
       - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}
   ```

4. **`docker-compose.prod.yml`** (production):
   ```yaml
   worker:
     environment:
       - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}
   ```

---

2. **@Mention Notification Test**:

   - [ ] Open card details modal
   - [ ] Add comment with @mention
   - [ ] Verify Slack message received
   - [ ] Check user mention is formatted correctly

3. **Error Handling Test**:

   - [ ] Temporarily break Slack webhook URL
   - [ ] Trigger notification
   - [ ] Verify worker retries job
   - [ ] Check queue dashboard shows retry count
   - [ ] Fix webhook URL
   - [ ] Verify delayed delivery succeeds

4. **Worker Logs Verification**:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f worker
   # or production:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f worker
   ```

5. **Queue Dashboard Check**:
   - [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/admin/queues`
   - [ ] Verify successful Slack deliveries in "Completed" count
   - [ ] Check for any failures in "Failed" count

## üîç **Slack Webhook Setup Guide**

### **Option 1: Incoming Webhooks (Simplest) - RECOMMENDED**

Since you already have access to the Slack workspace and can manage apps, follow these steps:

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Access Slack App Management**

   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Sign in with your Slack workspace account

2. **Create a New App**

   - Click **"Create New App"**
   - Select **"From scratch"**
   - App Name: `Content Reach Hub Notifications` (or any name you prefer)
   - Select your workspace from the dropdown
   - Click **"Create App"**

3. **Enable Incoming Webhooks**

   - In the left sidebar, click **"Incoming Webhooks"**
   - Toggle **"Activate Incoming Webhooks"** to **ON**

4. **Add Webhook to Workspace**

   - Scroll down to **"Webhook URLs for Your Workspace"**
   - Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**
   - Select the channel where notifications should be posted
     - Recommended: Create a dedicated channel like `#content-notifications` or `#reach-updates`
     - Alternative: Use existing channel like `#general` or `#team-updates`
   - Click **"Allow"**

5. **Copy Webhook URL**

   - A webhook URL will be generated, formatted like:
     ```
     https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
     ```
   - Click **"Copy"** button to copy the URL
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this URL secret** - it allows posting to your Slack workspace

6. **Add to Environment Variables**

   - Local development: Add to `frontend/.env.local`
     ```bash
     SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
     ```
   - VPS Production: Add to `.env` or `.env.production`
     ```bash
     SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
     ```

7. **Test the Webhook (Optional)**

   - You can test the webhook directly from Slack's interface
   - Or use curl:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --data '{"text":"üéâ Content Reach Hub notifications are now connected!"}' \
       https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
     ```

8. **Restart Worker Service**
   - Local: `docker compose restart worker`
   - Production: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart worker`

#### **Recommended Channel Setup**:

Create a dedicated Slack channel for notifications:

- Channel name: `#content-notifications` or `#reach-hub`
- Purpose: "Automated notifications from Content Reach Hub (assignments, mentions, updates)"
- Invite relevant team members who want to receive notifications

### **Option 2: Slack Bot (Advanced - Future Enhancement)**

For richer integrations (DMs, user mentions, interactive buttons):

1. Create Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Add Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `users:read`
3. Install app to workspace
4. Copy Bot Token (`xoxb-...`)
5. Use `@slack/web-api` SDK instead of webhooks

## üìä **Success Metrics**

‚úÖ **Implementation Complete When**:

- [ ] Slack webhook URL configured in worker service
- [ ] Assignment notifications sent to Slack successfully
- [ ] @Mention notifications sent to Slack successfully
- [ ] Message formatting displays correctly in Slack
- [ ] Error handling works (retries on failure)
- [ ] Worker logs show successful Slack deliveries
- [ ] Queue dashboard shows 0 failed Slack jobs
- [ ] Production deployment tested and verified

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Issue: Slack messages not sending**

**Possible Causes**:

- Webhook URL not configured or incorrect
- Worker service not reading environment variables
- Network connectivity issues

**Debug Steps**:

```bash
# Check worker environment variables
docker compose exec worker printenv | grep SLACK

# Check worker logs for errors
docker compose logs worker --tail=50

# Test webhook URL manually
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"Test notification"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### **Issue: Slack messages delayed**

**Possible Causes**:

- Queue backed up with jobs
- Worker processing slowly
- Rate limiting from Slack

**Debug Steps**:

```bash
# Check queue stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/queues/stats

# Check worker container resources
docker stats worker
```

### **Issue: Duplicate Slack messages**

**Possible Causes**:

- Multiple worker instances
- Job retry logic triggering incorrectly

**Debug Steps**:

- Check docker-compose for worker replicas
- Verify Bull job removal after success
- Check job IDs in worker logs

---

## üêõ **ISSUES DISCOVERED**

### **Issue #1: @Mention Feature Not Working in Comments**

**Problem Identified** (October 4, 2025)

**Issue**: Users cannot mention team members in comments using `@` symbol.

**Evidence**:

- Screenshot #2 shows comment input field with "test @" typed
- System shows "No team members found" message
- User autocomplete/mention feature appears broken

**Expected Behavior**:

- Typing `@` in comment field should show dropdown of team members
- Selecting a user should insert mention like `@Admin User`
- Mentioned user should receive notification

**Current Behavior**:

- `@` symbol typed but no autocomplete appears
- "No team members found" message displayed
- Cannot select users for mentions

### **Working Features (Verified)**:

‚úÖ **Assignments**: User assignment dialog works correctly (Screenshot #3)

- Shows full list of team members with roles
- Assignment notifications trigger successfully
- Slack notifications will work for assignments

### **Root Cause Analysis Needed**

**Possible Issues**:

1. **API Endpoint**: `/api/teams/[teamId]/members` may not be returning data
2. **Component State**: Mention autocomplete component not fetching users
3. **Team Context**: Comment component missing team ID for member lookup
4. **Search Logic**: Autocomplete filter not matching typed characters

### **Files to Investigate**:

1. **Comment Component**:

   - `frontend/src/components/comments/CommentInput.tsx` (or similar)
   - Check: User mention autocomplete logic
   - Check: API call to fetch team members

2. **API Route**:

   - `frontend/src/app/api/teams/[teamId]/members/route.ts`
   - Verify: Returns team members for current card's team
   - Check: Response format matches component expectations

3. **Component Rendering**:
   - Verify team ID is passed to comment component
   - Check console for API errors

### **Debugging Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Check browser console for errors when typing @ in comment
# Open DevTools ‚Üí Console while typing @ in comment field

# 2. Check Network tab for API calls
# DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Filter by "members" ‚Üí Look for 404/500 errors

# 3. Test API endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/teams/[TEAM_ID]/members

# 4. Check worker logs for mention notification attempts
docker compose logs worker | grep mention
```

### **Action Required**:

**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking Slack mention notifications

**Steps**:

1. [ ] Investigate why comment @mention autocomplete shows "No team members found"
2. [ ] Fix API endpoint or component to properly fetch team members
3. [ ] Test @mention functionality works in comment field
4. [ ] Verify mention notifications trigger queue jobs
5. [ ] Test Slack notifications for @mentions after fix

**Impact on Slack Integration**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Assignment notifications will work immediately (verified working)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è @Mention notifications blocked until comment mention feature is fixed
- Recommendation: Implement assignment notifications first, fix mentions as follow-up

---

### **Issue #2: User Creation Page Error (404)**

**Problem Identified** (October 4, 2025)

**Issue**: Clicking "Add User" button on `/dashboard/users` shows console error "Failed to fetch user"

**Evidence**:

- Screenshot shows User Management page with 6 users
- "Add User" button visible in top right
- Console error: `Failed to fetch user` from `src/app/dashboard/users/[userId]/page.tsx:123`
- Error appears to be trying to fetch a user when creating new user (should be empty form)

**Expected Behavior**:

- Clicking "Add User" should show empty form for creating new user
- No API call to fetch user (since user doesn't exist yet)
- Form should have fields: firstName, lastName, email, role

**Current Behavior**:

- Page attempts to fetch user data (invalid for new user creation)
- Console error thrown
- Likely showing broken/empty page

### **Root Cause Analysis**:

**Possible Issues**:

1. **Routing Issue**: "Add User" button navigates to `/dashboard/users/new` but page expects UUID
2. **Page Logic**: User edit page `[userId]/page.tsx` doesn't handle "new" case
3. **Missing Page**: No dedicated `/dashboard/users/new/page.tsx` for user creation
4. **Component Logic**: Edit page tries to fetch user even when creating new

### **Files to Investigate**:

1. **User List Page**:

   - `frontend/src/app/dashboard/users/page.tsx`
   - Check: "Add User" button onClick handler
   - Check: Where does it navigate to?

2. **User Edit/Create Page**:

   - `frontend/src/app/dashboard/users/[userId]/page.tsx`
   - Check: Does it handle "new" user case?
   - Check: Line 123 - `fetchUser()` call

3. **Potential Solution Options**:
   - **Option A**: Create separate `/dashboard/users/new/page.tsx` for user creation
   - **Option B**: Modify `[userId]/page.tsx` to detect `userId === 'new'` and skip fetch
   - **Option C**: Use modal dialog for user creation instead of separate page

### **Action Required**:

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Blocking admin user management

**Steps**:

1. [ ] Investigate "Add User" button navigation target
2. [ ] Fix user creation page to not fetch user data
3. [ ] Implement proper user creation form
4. [ ] Test user creation flow end-to-end
5. [ ] Add Slack notification for new user creation

---

### **Issue #3: Missing New User Welcome Notification**

**Enhancement Requested** (October 4, 2025)

**Feature**: When a new user is created, send Slack notification to welcome them

**Proposed Notification**:

```
üëã *New Team Member Added*
Welcome <User Name> to the team!
Email: user@example.com
Role: Scriptwriter
Added by: Admin User
```

**Implementation**:

- Add notification type: `user_created`
- Trigger from user creation API (`POST /api/users`)
- Send to general team channel or dedicated onboarding channel
- Include user details and who created the account

**Priority**: LOW - Enhancement for Phase 1
**Can be added**: During assignment notification implementation

---

## üìù **Notes & Considerations**

### **Rate Limiting**:

- Slack allows ~1 message per second per webhook
- Bull queue handles this naturally with sequential processing
- For high volume, consider batching notifications

### **Message Formatting Best Practices**:

- Use Slack Block Kit for rich formatting
- Include actionable links (deep links to cards)
- Keep messages concise and scannable
- Use emojis for visual categorization

### **Future Enhancements**:

- [ ] Interactive buttons (Approve/Reject from Slack)
- [ ] DM notifications instead of channel messages
- [ ] Slack user ID mapping (mention users by Slack handle)
- [ ] Notification preferences (opt-in/opt-out per user)
- [ ] Digest notifications (daily summary instead of real-time)

### **Security**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit webhook URLs to Git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use environment variables only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate webhook URLs if exposed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider using Slack signing secrets for webhooks

## üêõ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE ISSUES DISCOVERED** (October 4, 2025)

### **Issue #4: Team vs Client Confusion**

**Problem**: Major confusion between Teams and Clients in the application architecture.

**Current Broken Flow**:

1. User creates "Client" (e.g., "Acme Corp") in Client Management
2. Clicking client navigates to Kanban board for that "team"
3. Creating cards works, but **no team members exist** for assignment
4. Assignment dropdown is empty because new client has no team members

**Root Cause**:

- `clients` table references `teams` table with `isClient=true` flag
- When creating a client, a team is created but **no team members are added**
- Kanban board expects team members to exist for assignments
- New users are added to "first team" but not to client-specific teams

**Architecture Questions**:

1. **What is a "Team"?**

   - Internal team (e.g., "Test Agency Team")?
   - Or client organization (e.g., "Acme Corp")?

2. **What is a "Client"?**

   - External client company?
   - Or internal team working on client project?

3. **Who should appear in assignment dropdown?**
   - Internal agency team members who work across all clients?
   - Client-specific team members assigned to that client?

**Current Database Structure**:

```sql
teams
  - id
  - name
  - isClient (boolean)

team_members
  - team_id (references teams)
  - user_id (references users)

clients (extends teams where isClient=true)
  - company_name
  - industry
  - contact_person
```

**Expected Behavior** (needs clarification):

- **Option A: Agency-Centric Model**

  - One main "Agency Team" with all internal staff
  - Clients are just metadata (company info)
  - All internal users can be assigned to any client's cards
  - Assignment dropdown shows all agency team members

- **Option B: Client-Centric Model**
  - Each client has their own team
  - Agency users are added to multiple client teams
  - Assignment dropdown shows only users assigned to that client's team
  - More granular access control per client

**Current Broken State**:

- Mix of both models causing confusion
- New client ‚Üí new team ‚Üí **no members** ‚Üí broken assignments
- Team management UI doesn't exist (only client management)
- No way to add users to client teams

**Immediate Impact**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot assign users to cards in new client projects
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Assignment dropdown empty for all new clients
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No UI to manage team membership
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-add new user only adds to "first team", not all teams

**Required Decisions Before Proceeding**:

1. Clarify business model: Agency-centric or Client-centric?
2. How should team membership work?
3. Should there be a "Team Management" page separate from "Client Management"?
4. How to bulk-add internal users to all client teams?

**Temporary Workaround**:

- Manually add users to teams via SQL:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO team_members (team_id, user_id)
  VALUES ('<client_team_id>', '<user_id>');
  ```

**Priority**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Blocking all client assignment workflows

---

## ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE ISSUE RESOLVED** (October 4, 2025)

### **Solution Implemented: Agency-Centric Model**

**Decision**: Chose **Option A - Agency-Centric Model** for simpler workflow management.

**Implementation Summary**:

1. **Main Agency Team Created**

   - Renamed "Test Agency Team" ‚Üí "Main Agency Team"
   - Database: `teams` table where `is_client = false`
   - Description: "Internal agency team - all staff members"

2. **Team Membership Model**

   ```
   Main Agency Team (Internal)
     ‚îú‚îÄ Admin User
     ‚îú‚îÄ Rodelo Escueta (Coordinator)
     ‚îú‚îÄ Strategy Lead
     ‚îú‚îÄ Script Writer
     ‚îú‚îÄ Video Editor
     ‚îú‚îÄ Content Coordinator
     ‚îî‚îÄ Team Member

   Clients (Metadata only)
     ‚îú‚îÄ Acme Corp
     ‚îú‚îÄ TechVision Media
     ‚îî‚îÄ Bright Future Media
   ```

3. **Auto-Add Logic**

   - **File**: `frontend/src/app/api/users/route.ts`
   - New users (non-client role) automatically added to Main Agency Team
   - Uses `is_client = false` filter to find Main Agency Team
   - Client users excluded from auto-add

4. **Assignment Dropdown - Agency-Wide**

   - **New API**: `/api/teams/agency/members` - Returns all Main Agency Team members
   - **New Hook**: `useAgencyMembers()` in `lib/hooks/useAssignments.ts`
   - **Updated Component**: `AssignmentPanel.tsx` now uses `useAgencyMembers()` instead of `useTeamMembers(teamId)`
   - **Result**: ALL agency members appear in dropdown regardless of which client's board

5. **Database Changes**
   - Updated team name: "Test Agency Team" ‚Üí "Main Agency Team"
   - No schema changes needed (architecture already supported this model)

**Benefits Achieved**:

- ‚úÖ All agency staff can be assigned to any client's cards
- ‚úÖ No need to manage per-client team membership
- ‚úÖ Simple onboarding: new user ‚Üí auto-added to Main Agency Team
- ‚úÖ Clients remain as project metadata (company name, industry, contact)
- ‚úÖ Assignment dropdown always populated with all staff

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/app/api/users/route.ts` - Auto-add to Main Agency Team
- `frontend/src/app/api/teams/agency/members/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `frontend/src/lib/hooks/useAssignments.ts` - New `useAgencyMembers()` hook
- `frontend/src/components/assignments/AssignmentPanel.tsx` - Use agency members

**Testing Confirmed**:

- ‚úÖ All 7 users in Main Agency Team
- ‚úÖ Assignment dropdown shows all agency members on any client board
- ‚úÖ New users auto-added to Main Agency Team
- ‚úÖ Client creation still works (metadata only)

**Status**: üü¢ **RESOLVED** - Agency-centric architecture fully implemented
