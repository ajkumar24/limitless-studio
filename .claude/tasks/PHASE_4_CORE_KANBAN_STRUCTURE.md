// Role-based access control implemented
// Returns stages with color, position, and descriptions
```

**REACH Stages Configuration**:
- **Research** (Blue #3b82f6): "Research and ideation phase"
- **Envision** (Purple #8b5cf6): "Content planning and framework design"

## 🐛 **Critical Issues Resolved During Implementation**

### **Issue 1: Card Creation teamId Undefined**
- **Problem**: `CreateCardModal` was using `useParams()` to get `teamId` from URL, but dashboard route `/dashboard` doesn't contain teamId parameter
- **Solution**: Restructured component prop flow to pass `teamId` through component hierarchy
- **Files Modified**:
  - `KanbanBoard.tsx` → `KanbanColumn.tsx` → `CreateCardButton.tsx` → `CreateCardModal.tsx`
- **Result**: Card creation now works perfectly with `201 Created` responses

### **Issue 2: Next.js 15 API Parameter Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Next.js 15 requires awaiting `params` in API routes, causing "params should be awaited" errors
- **Solution**: Updated all API routes to use `Promise<{ params }>` pattern and await params
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/api/teams/[teamId]/stages/route.ts`
  - `/api/teams/[teamId]/cards/route.ts`
  - `/api/cards/[cardId]/route.ts`
- **Result**: All API routes return 200/201 responses instead of 500 errors

### **Issue 3: SQL Alias Conflicts in Card Queries**
- **Problem**: Database queries were using `users` table twice without proper aliases, causing "Alias 'users' already used" errors
- **Solution**: Implemented Drizzle ORM `alias()` function for distinct user table references
- **Files Modified**:
  - `getTeamCards()` function in `src/lib/db/utils.ts`
  - `getContentCard()` function in `src/lib/db/utils.ts`
- **Result**: Card queries now return full relationships without SQL errors

### **Issue 4: Database Schema Mismatches**
- **Problem**: Code expected `color`, `content`, and `tags` columns that didn't exist in database
- **Solution**: Verified database schema and confirmed all columns exist as expected
- **Result**: All database operations working without column errors
