## üî¥ **Critical Gaps Discovered (BLOCKING ISSUES)**

Based on user testing, these critical features are **missing** and should be prioritized:

### **Issue 1: User Edit Functionality - 404 Error** üö® **CRITICAL**
**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
**Discovered**: October 3, 2025
**Impact**: Admin cannot edit user records

**Problem**:
- User management page (`/dashboard/users`) displays all users ‚úÖ
- "Edit" button exists and navigates to `/dashboard/users/[userId]` ‚ùå
- **Route returns 404** - page does not exist
- No API endpoint for updating user records

**Required**:
- [ ] Create `/dashboard/users/[userId]/page.tsx` - User edit page
- [ ] Create `/api/users/[userId]/route.ts` - GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- [ ] Form to edit: firstName, lastName, email, role
- [ ] Email uniqueness validation
- [ ] Role dropdown with all 7 roles
- [ ] Admin-only access control
- [ ] Audit log for user updates

**Reference**: See `USER_MANAGEMENT_EDIT_FEATURE.md` for full implementation plan
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Blocking admin workflows

---

### **Issue 2: Role Permissions Documentation Mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFICATION NEEDED**

**Reference Image**: User provided role permissions table showing:

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Admin / Manager | Oversees all operations, reviews performance | Full access |
| Strategist | Approves scripts, edits, and final videos | Approve, comment, reassign |
| Scriptwriter | Writes and revises scripts | Access Research + Envision |
| Editor / Designer | Edits videos, designs thumbnails | Access Assemble + Connect |
| Coordinator | Orchestrates end-to-end workflow, manages handoffs, ensures timeline adherence, publishes content | Research/Envision/Assemble: Read-only - Connect/Hone: Full access |
| AI System | Acts as project manager | Alert, escalate, track |

**Current Implementation** (`/frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts`):

```typescript
const PERMISSION_MATRIX: Record<UserRole, Record<StageName, PermissionLevel>> = {
  admin: { research: 'full', envision: 'full', assemble: 'full', connect: 'full', hone: 'full' },
  strategist: { research: 'comment_approve', envision: 'comment_approve', assemble: 'comment_approve', connect: 'comment_approve', hone: 'comment_approve' },
  scriptwriter: { research: 'full', envision: 'full', assemble: 'read_only', connect: 'read_only', hone: 'read_only' },
  editor: { research: 'read_only', envision: 'read_only', assemble: 'full', connect: 'full', hone: 'read_only' },
  coordinator: { research: 'read_only', envision: 'read_only', assemble: 'read_only', connect: 'full', hone: 'full' },
  member: { research: 'full', envision: 'full', assemble: 'full', connect: 'comment_approve', hone: 'read_only' },
  client: { research: 'none', envision: 'none', assemble: 'none', connect: 'comment_approve', hone: 'read_only' },
}
```

**Comparison**:

‚úÖ **Admin**: Matches (Full access everywhere)
‚úÖ **Strategist**: Matches (Comment/approve all stages)
‚úÖ **Scriptwriter**: Matches (Research + Envision full, others read-only)
‚úÖ **Editor**: Matches (Assemble + Connect full, others read-only)
‚úÖ **Coordinator**: Matches (Connect + Hone full, Research/Envision/Assemble read-only)
‚ùì **Member**: Not in requirements doc (appears to be extra role)
‚úÖ **Client**: Matches (Connect comment/approve, Hone read-only)

**Verification Needed**:
- [ ] Confirm "member" role is intentional or should be removed
- [ ] Document "member" role permissions if intentional
- [ ] Update role descriptions on users page to match requirements doc exactly

**Priority**: MEDIUM - System works but documentation should align

## üìù **Notes for User**

Based on your roadmap and current system state:

1. **Top Priority**: Fix the user edit 404 issue - this is blocking your admin workflows right now
2. **Quick Win**: Verify role permissions are working as expected (looks good in code)
3. **Before Deployment**: Complete user management and test client features
4. **Then Deploy**: VPS staging deployment after core features are solid

The system is at **95% completion** according to roadmap. The user edit feature is a critical gap that should be addressed before moving to deployment phase.

**Recommended Next Action**: Start with `USER_MANAGEMENT_EDIT_FEATURE.md` implementation (3-4 hours)
