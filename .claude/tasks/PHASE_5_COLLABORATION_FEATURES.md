Transform individual card management into collaborative team workflows with:
- **Rich Comments System** with @mentions and threading
- **File Upload System** supporting PDFs, images, and documents
- **User Assignments & Notifications** for task ownership
- **Slack Integration** for workflow notifications
- **Enhanced Team Collaboration** across content cards
