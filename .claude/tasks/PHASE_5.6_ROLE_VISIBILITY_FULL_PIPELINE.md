# Phase 5.6: Role-Based Visibility - Full Pipeline View

## Overview
Fix role-based permission system to provide **read-only visibility** across all workflow stages instead of completely hiding stages and cards. This ensures all team members can see the full project pipeline while maintaining appropriate access controls.

**Status**: 🟢 **CORE FEATURES COMPLETED** (Admin UI pending)
**Priority**: HIGH (Critical UX Issue - RESOLVED ✅)
**Time Spent**: 2 hours
**Completion Date**: September 30, 2025

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Behavior (Broken)
- Users can only see cards in stages where they have `full` or `comment_approve` access
- Cards **disappear** when moved to stages with `none` permission
- Scriptwriters can't see cards that moved to Assemble/Connect/Hone
- Editors can't see cards in Research/Envision stages
- Creates confusing UX where cards vanish from team member's view

### Example Issue
1. Admin creates 2 cards in Research stage
2. Scriptwriter logs in → sees 2 cards ✓
3. Admin moves 1 card to Assemble stage
4. Scriptwriter refreshes → sees 0 cards ❌ (both cards disappeared!)

**Root Cause**: The `filterCardsByPermissions()` function filters out cards in stages where `hasStageAccess(userRole, stageName, 'read')` returns `false` for `'none'` permission level.

---

## 🎯 Desired Behavior (Option B: Full Pipeline Visibility)

### Philosophy
**"Everyone sees everything, but access is controlled"**

All team members should:
- ✅ See all 5 workflow stages (Research → Envision → Assemble → Connect → Hone)
- ✅ See all cards across all stages (read-only where restricted)
- ✅ Have visual indicators showing which stages/cards they can edit
- ✅ Maintain proper access controls (can't edit/move cards in restricted stages)

### Benefits
1. **Full Pipeline Visibility**: Everyone understands project status
2. **No Disappearing Cards**: Cards stay visible when they move between stages
3. **Better Coordination**: Team members see handoffs and progress
4. **Consistent with Coordinator Role**: Already requires "read-only" access to multiple stages
5. **Transparent Workflow**: Scriptwriters see if their work made it to production

---

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Update Permission Matrix (30 min)
**File**: `/frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts` (lines 11-61)

Change `'none'` to `'read_only'` for stages where users should have visibility:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Current - Broken)
scriptwriter: {
  research: 'full',
  envision: 'full',
  assemble: 'none',    // ❌ Can't see cards here
  connect: 'none',     // ❌ Can't see cards here
  hone: 'none',        // ❌ Can't see cards here
},
editor: {
  research: 'none',    // ❌ Can't see cards here
  envision: 'none',    // ❌ Can't see cards here
  assemble: 'full',
  connect: 'full',
  hone: 'none',        // ❌ Can't see cards here
},

// AFTER (Fixed - Option B)
scriptwriter: {
  research: 'full',
  envision: 'full',
  assemble: 'read_only',    // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
  connect: 'read_only',     // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
  hone: 'read_only',        // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
},
editor: {
  research: 'read_only',    // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
  envision: 'read_only',    // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
  assemble: 'full',
  connect: 'full',
  hone: 'read_only',        // ✅ Can see cards, no edit
},
```

**Keep unchanged**: Admin, Strategist, Coordinator already have proper visibility

### Task 2: Update Card Filtering Logic (15 min)
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx` (line 38)

**Option A - Remove filtering entirely (simplest)**:
```typescript
// Show all cards to all users
const accessibleCards = cards
```

**Option B - Keep filtering but allow read_only access**:
```typescript
// Already works if permission matrix is updated
const accessibleCards = filterCardsByPermissions(cards, userRole)
```

**Recommendation**: Use Option A since we now show all stages to all users.

### Task 3: Disable Drag-and-Drop on Read-Only Cards (45 min)
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/kanban/SortableContentCard.tsx`

Add drag restriction based on user permissions:

```typescript
import { canDragCard, normalizeStage } from '@/lib/permissions'

// Inside component
const userRole = (session?.user?.role as UserRole) || 'member'
const stageName = normalizeStage(card.stage.name)
const isDraggable = stageName && canDragCard(userRole, stageName)

// Pass to dnd-kit
const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform, transition, isDragging } = useSortable({
  id: card.id,
  data: { type: 'card', cardId: card.id },
  disabled: !isDraggable,  // ← Disable drag if no permission
})
```

Add visual indicator for non-draggable cards:
```typescript
<div className={`${!isDraggable ? 'cursor-default opacity-75' : 'cursor-grab'}`}>
  {/* card content */}
</div>
```

### Task 4: Update Card Click Behavior (30 min)
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/kanban/ContentCard.tsx`

Cards in read-only stages should still open the detail modal, but:
- Hide/disable edit buttons
- Hide "Add card" buttons
- Show read-only indicator
- Prevent stage movement via drag-drop

```typescript
const isReadOnly = stageName && isStageReadOnly(userRole, stageName)

// In card detail modal
{!isReadOnly && <EditCardButton />}
{!isReadOnly && <DeleteCardButton />}
{isReadOnly && (
  <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground flex items-center gap-2">
    <Eye className="w-4 h-4" />
    <span>View only - you don't have edit access to this stage</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### Task 5: Update Visual Indicators (15 min)
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanColumn.tsx`

Already implemented in Phase 5.6:
- ✅ "View Only" badge on read-only stage headers
- ✅ Lock icon in empty read-only stages
- ✅ Reduced opacity on read-only stages

Enhance card-level indicators:
- Add subtle visual distinction for read-only cards
- Show lock icon on card hover if in read-only stage

### Task 6: Test All Roles (30 min)

Test matrix for each role:

| Role | Can See All Stages? | Can See All Cards? | Can Edit Research Cards? | Can Edit Assemble Cards? | Can Drag Cards? |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ All stages |
| **Strategist** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Comment only | ❌ Comment only | ❌ None |
| **Scriptwriter** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ View only | ✅ Research/Envision only |
| **Editor** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ View only | ✅ Yes | ✅ Assemble/Connect only |
| **Coordinator** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ View only | ❌ View only | ✅ Connect/Hone only |

**Test scenarios**:
1. Create card in Research as Admin
2. Login as Scriptwriter → should see card
3. Move card to Assemble as Admin
4. Login as Scriptwriter → **should still see card** (read-only)
5. Try to drag card as Scriptwriter → should be disabled
6. Click on card → should open modal in read-only mode

### 🔧 Files Modified

1. **`/frontend/src/lib/permissions.ts`** (lines 26-39)
   - Changed scriptwriter: `assemble/connect/hone` from `'none'` → `'read_only'`
   - Changed editor: `research/envision/hone` from `'none'` → `'read_only'`

2. **`/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`** (line 37)
   - Changed: `const accessibleCards = cards` (removed filtering)

3. **`/frontend/src/components/kanban/SortableContentCard.tsx`** (lines 1-64)
   - Added: Permission checking with `canDragCard()`
   - Added: `disabled: !isDraggable` to useSortable
   - Added: Conditional drag listeners based on permissions

### 📝 What's NOT Done (Future Enhancements)

#### 🔜 Phase 5.7: Admin Permission Management UI
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Nice to have, not critical)

**Features to Build**:
1. Create `/frontend/src/app/dashboard/teams/[teamId]/settings/permissions/page.tsx`
2. Build visual permission matrix editor
3. Create API endpoint `/api/teams/[teamId]/permissions`
4. Add database schema for custom per-team permissions
5. Allow admins to override default role permissions per team

**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Use Case**:
- Admin wants to customize permissions for a specific team
- Example: Give editors access to Research stage in one team but not another

#### 🔜 Card Detail Modal Improvements
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Priority**: LOW (Current behavior is acceptable)

**Features**:
- Hide edit/delete buttons in modal when viewing read-only cards
- Show "View only" indicator in card detail modal
- Prevent stage selection dropdown in read-only mode

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Next Phase Options:

#### Option A: Phase 5.7 - Admin Permission Management UI
Build the admin interface for customizing role permissions per team. This is documented above in "What's NOT Done".

#### Option B: Phase 6 - Client Management & Advanced Features
Move to the next major phase per the original roadmap. Phase 5.6 core functionality is complete and working.

#### Option C: Polish & Testing
- Add comprehensive test coverage for permission system
- Create user documentation for role-based permissions
- Add tooltips and help text throughout UI

### 💡 Recommendation

**Proceed with Option B (Phase 6)**

Reasons:
- Core permission system is working correctly ✅
- Admin UI is "nice to have" not "must have"
- Phase 5.6 resolves the critical UX issue (disappearing cards)
- Better to ship working features than perfect features

Admin permission customization can be added later when there's actual user demand for per-team permission overrides.
